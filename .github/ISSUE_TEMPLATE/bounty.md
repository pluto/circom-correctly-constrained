- [ ] Bonus Feature 2

**Resources**

A list of potentially-useful resources. This list should be less than 5 total resources. 

**Criteria**

For timely submissions of bounties that meet the implementation requirements, a bounty of at least $250 will be awarded to the contributor. Additional bounty amounts are available and will be rewarded based on the following criteria:

1. Completion of any of the bonus features listed above and/or other bonus features that improve the quality of the submission. 
2. Correctness and security: A thorough review of the implementation should convince our team that they are correct and secure, with all requirements met.
3. Code clarity and quality: Succinct, easy-to-follow code with appropriate naming conventions. Utilize Rust’s type system for flexibility and security (e.g., compile-time checks where possible), and avoid external crates. Optimizations should be a lower priority than clarity, but can be included behind a feature flag as a bonus.
4. Documentation quality: Provide comprehensive README’s, Cargo docs, and inline comments where code itself is not self-explanatory. Prioritize clarity and readability.
